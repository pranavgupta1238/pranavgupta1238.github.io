Meaning of Depreciation:
Depreciation is the accounting process of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. As an asset is used over time, its value decreases due to factors like wear and tear, obsolescence, and aging. Depreciation allows businesses to gradually expense the cost of these assets rather than accounting for it all at once.

Importance of Depreciation:

1. Accurate Financial Reporting: Depreciation helps businesses reflect the true value of their assets over time. Without accounting for depreciation, financial statements may overstate the worth of an asset.
2. Matching Principle: In accounting, depreciation aligns with the matching principle, which ensures expenses are matched with the revenue they help generate. Spreading the cost of an asset over its useful life ensures that expenses are recorded in the same periods as the benefits from the asset.
3. Tax Benefits: Depreciation is a non-cash expense, which means companies can deduct depreciation expenses from their taxable income, lowering tax liability.
4. Asset Management: Depreciation helps companies understand the useful life of their assets and plan for replacements. By knowing how long assets will last, businesses can better budget for future investments.
5. Investment Decisions: Depreciation provides insight into the total cost of ownership for assets, helping businesses make informed decisions on whether to maintain, sell, or replace an asset.
6. 
In summary, depreciation is crucial for accurate accounting, tax management, and long-term business planning.
